## Migrations

This directory contains database migrations managed by Alembic.

### Creating a new migration

To create a new migration after making changes to your models:

1. Make sure your models are up to date in `app/models/`
2. Run: `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Your migration message"`
3. Review the generated migration file in `versions/`
4. Apply the migration: `alembic upgrade head`

### Common Commands

- `alembic current` - Show current revision
- `alembic history` - Show revision history
- `alembic upgrade <revision>` - Upgrade to a specific revision
- `alembic downgrade <revision>` - Downgrade to a specific revision
- `alembic upgrade head` - Upgrade to the latest revision
- `alembic downgrade base` - Downgrade all the way down

### Environment

Database connection settings are configured in `alembic.ini` under `sqlalchemy.url`.
For development, this is set to connect to the PostgreSQL container.
